== NAME

xedgewarp - window manager agnostic pointer warping between outputs

== SYNOPSIS

xedgewarp [-b] [-m closest|relative] [-l error|debug|trace] [-h] [-v]

== OPTIONS

-b::
Run in background mode, i.e. fork on startup.

-m closest|relative::
Specifies how the mouse pointer should be warped. With "closest", the pointer
is warped only as little as necessary to the closest edge on the output. With
"relative", the relative position (e.g., "75% from the top") on the current
output is calculated and then used on the target output.

-t none|vertical|horizontal|both::
Connect the far edges of all outputs as if they were to form a torus shape.
This means, for example, that moving the cursor to the far left edge, instead
of staying there, it will be warped to the far right edge of the far right
output.

-l error|debug|trace::
Specify the log level.

-h::
Display the usage and exit.

-v::
Display the version and exit.

== DESCRIPTION

When using multiple outputs, this tool will automatically warp the mouse
pointer in case outputs aren't perfectly aligned and the same size. While some
desktop environments may provide this functionality, xedgewarp can offer
it to those running no desktop environment or one that does not offer this
functionality.

Consider, for example, the output layout below. If you moved your mouse pointer
from left to right to the position marked with ">", it would simply hit a wall
and not move any further.

With xedgewarp, the pointer will be automatically warped to either position "1"
("closest" mode) or "2" ("relative" mode).
